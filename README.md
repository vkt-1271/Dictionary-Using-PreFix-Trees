# ðŸ“š Dictionary Using Prefix Trees (Trie)

This project implements a **Dictionary** data structure using **Prefix Trees (Tries)** to provide efficient word storage, lookup, and auto-completion functionality. Designed in C++, it mimics the behavior of real-world dictionaries and is optimized for fast prefix-based search operations.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- Built a Trie-based dictionary for storing and retrieving words efficiently  
- Supports word **insertion**, **search**, and **auto-suggestion** based on prefixes  
- Ideal for applications like auto-complete, spell-checkers, and search engines  
- Emphasizes time-efficient lookups with linear time complexity per word

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- Insert new words into the dictionary  
- Search for exact words
- Search for synonym 
- Suggest a list of possible words based on a given prefix  
- Can be extended for delete, word count, or wildcard search

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **C++** â€“ Core implementation language  
- **STL (Standard Template Library)** â€“ For managing dynamic data structures
- Header files for TRIE and UI implementation  
- File I/O for loading and storing dictionary data  


## ðŸ’¡ Use Cases

- Auto-complete in search engines  
- Spell-check or auto-correction engines  
- Text editors and IDEs for code prediction 
- Language processing and word games

## ðŸ™Œ Acknowledgments

- Trie-based algorithms from academic coursework
